# Spam-SMS-Deployment-Classifier
SMS (Short Message Service) is still the primary choice as a communication medium even though nowadays the mobile is growing with a variety of communication media messenger applications. However, nowadays along with the SMS tariff reduction leads to the increase of SMS spam, as used by some people as an alternative to advertising and fraud.  Therefore, it becomes an important issue as it can bug and harm the users and one of its solutions is with automatic SMS spam filtering. One of the most challenging in SMS spam filtering is its accuracy.  In this research, I have proposed to enhanced SMS spam filtering performance by combining two data mining task association and classification. FP-growth in the association is utilized for mining frequent pattern on SMS and Naive Bayes Classifier is used to classify whether SMS is spam or ham. The result of using the collaboration of Naive Bayes and FP-Growth performs the highest average accuracy of 98, 506% and 0,025% better than without using FP-Growth for dataset SMS Spam Collection v.1, and improves the precision score; thus, the classification result is more accurate.
